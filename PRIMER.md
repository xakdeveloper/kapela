# The Kapela Project
> A Primer

Overview: Kapela is a blockchain-powered messaging and payment platform. Messages and payments can be sent as anonymously and securely as one would require, and with a decentralized structure, there is no single point of failure where stored data can be accessed without the permission of a user's private key signature. This results in a cross-platform method of transacting that we are all used to, but without the censorship we face on a daily basis.

## Main Idea:

The main idea of The Kapela Project was to fork the DigitalNote project. The decline of DigitalNote can be found in the lack of developer support, as the community seems to still pursue activity and growth, but are not receiving the support needed to even operate the software efficiently. We have no plans on picking up a project from the ashes without receiving a large stake in such project, and with no central authority to dictate such stakes, we are left with the clear solution of forking the software and consuming the previous community base.

In order to expand Kapela as fast a possible, we decided it would be best to rebuild the C++ implementation using JavaScript. This would allow us to focus on a web application, and with a few tweaks we can get both desktop and mobile versions launched. Once the JavaScript implementation is live, we will scrap the old DigitalNote C++ code, and build new software in Go for miners and nodes. At this point, we would have a completely in-house operation with no main code coming from the old DigitalNote team.

TL;DR: C++ to JavaScript. Web, Desktop, and Mobile applications. Source and tools in Go for miners and nodes.


## Extended Idea:

The extended idea of The Kapela Project is to develop a Proof-of-Stake decentralized full-suite communications platform and payment gateway. With a PoS consensus model, the average, and majority, of users will not have to sync with the blockchain or even run a node to participate in the network. By initiating simple P2P verification with a validator node, gateway node or similar, a user has full operational capabilities on the network. This of course allows anyone with a computer and some coins the ability to upkeep the network in a similar manner as a Proof-of-Work miner on a common blockchain, but with less computational restrictions. This is especially important since the target audience will be mobile users who simply want secure uncensorable communications and a fluid method of transacting and storing their digital assets. Due to the projected audience, the mobility of the Kapela network will play a major part in its growth.

In order to meet the cross-platform standards, all of the internal systems and modules of Kapela that are client side will be written and handled in JavaScript. With the release of an initial alpha web application, users will be able to utilize their browser for test connections to peers, at which point they can send instant messages and basic coin transfers. As we develop closer to beta version for the web application, all of the described features and technology in this Primer will be implemented. The source code for the web application will then be tweaked for integration with both [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) for cross-platform desktop application, and with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for cross-platform mobile applications.

With different functionality being present in different segments of Kapela, there are different nodes that are utilized for these features to work in scale:
- **Validator Nodes:** for blockchain consensus
- **Gateway Nodes:** for extended access to the network
- **Storage Nodes:** for sharded file storage
- **Client Nodes:** all base users on the network<br>
    - **Verified Nodes:** verified clients for social networking

All nodes are in contact with the Validator Nodes in some way, and by conducting operations, these nodes earn coin emissions on the network as well as any fees for intensive transactions by users.
